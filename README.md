# SomeShadyTweaks

This is a mod where I put tweaks which I feel give too much of anadvantage? and hence does not belong in SomeOrdinaryTweaks.
# Why?/For Whom?

The intended audience for this mod is players who are playing in singleplayer or in communities in which the main focus is not PvE, and certain aspects of the gameplay gets in the way of their playstyle
   
**If you are here to judge playstyles, Touch Grass ~~(Astroturf prefered over organic grass)~~. Its a sandbox game and I do not fucking care about your opinion about how to play it "correctly". IDC as long you aren't using this in a community that does not welcome this sort of mod to gain an unfair advantage**
